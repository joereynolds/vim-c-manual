7.21.9.4 The ftell function
Synopsis

#include <stdio.h>
long int ftell(FILE *stream);
Description

2

The ftell function obtains the current value of the file position indicator for the stream
pointed to by stream. For a binary stream, the value is the number of characters from
the beginning of the file. For a text stream, its file position indicator contains unspecified
information, usable by the fseek function for returning the file position indicator for the
stream to its position at the time of the ftell call; the difference between two such
return values is not necessarily a meaningful measure of the number of characters written

If successful, the ftell function returns the current value of the file position indicator
for the stream. On failure, the ftell function returns −1L and stores an
implementation-defined positive value in errno.
