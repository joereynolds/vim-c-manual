Description
2

The cnd_timedwait function atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mtx and
endeavors to block until the condition variable pointed to by cond is signaled by a call to
cnd_signal or to cnd_broadcast, or until after the TIME_UTC-based calendar
time pointed to by ts. When the calling thread becomes unblocked it locks the variable
pointed to by mtx before it returns. The cnd_timedwait function requires that the
mutex pointed to by mtx be locked by the calling thread.
Returns

3

The cnd_timedwait function returns thrd_success upon success, or
thrd_timedout if the time specified in the call was reached without acquiring the
requested resource, or thrd_error if the request could not be honored.
