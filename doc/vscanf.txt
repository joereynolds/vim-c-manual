7.21.6.11 The vscanf function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int vscanf(const char * restrict format,
va_list arg);
Description

2

The vscanf function is equivalent to scanf, with the variable argument list replaced
by arg, which shall have been initialized by the va_start macro (and possibly
subsequent va_arg calls). The vscanf function does not invoke the va_end
macro.288)
Returns

3

The vscanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
before the first conversion (if any) has completed. Otherwise, the vscanf function
returns the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even
zero, in the event of an early matching failure.
