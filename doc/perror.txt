7.21.10.4 The perror function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
void perror(const char *s);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The perror function maps the error number in the integer expression errno to an
error message. It writes a sequence of characters to the standard error stream thus: first
(if s is not a null pointer and the character pointed to by s is not the null character), the
string pointed to by s followed by a colon (:) and a space; then an appropriate error
message string followed by a new-line character. The contents of the error message
strings are the same as those returned by the strerror function with argument errno.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The perror function returns no value.
Forward references: the strerror function (7.24.6.2).

7.22 General utilities <stdlib.h>
1

The header <stdlib.h> declares five types and several functions of general utility, and
defines several macros.291)

2

The types declared are size_t and wchar_t (both described in 7.19),
div_t
which is a structure type that is the type of the value returned by the div function,
ldiv_t
which is a structure type that is the type of the value returned by the ldiv function, and
lldiv_t
which is a structure type that is the type of the value returned by the lldiv function.

3

The macros defined are NULL (described in 7.19);
EXIT_FAILURE
and
EXIT_SUCCESS
which expand to integer constant expressions that can be used as the argument to the
exit function to return unsuccessful or successful termination status, respectively, to the
host environment;
RAND_MAX
which expands to an integer constant expression that is the maximum value returned by
the rand function; and
MB_CUR_MAX
which expands to a positive integer expression with type size_t that is the maximum
number of bytes in a multibyte character for the extended character set specified by the
current locale (category LC_CTYPE), which is never greater than MB_LEN_MAX.

291) See ‘‘future library directions’’ (7.31.12).

7.22.1 Numeric conversion functions
1

The functions atof, atoi, atol, and atoll need not affect the value of the integer
expression errno on an error. If the value of the result cannot be represented, the
behavior is undefined.
