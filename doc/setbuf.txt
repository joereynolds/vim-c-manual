7.21.5.5 The setbuf function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
void setbuf(FILE * restrict stream,
char * restrict buf);
Description

2

Except that it returns no value, the setbuf function is equivalent to the setvbuf
function invoked with the values _IOFBF for mode and BUFSIZ for size, or (if buf
is a null pointer), with the value _IONBF for mode.

272) The primary use of the freopen function is to change the file associated with a standard text stream
(stderr, stdin, or stdout), as those identifiers need not be modifiable lvalues to which the value
returned by the fopen function may be assigned.
