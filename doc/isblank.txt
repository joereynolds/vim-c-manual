Description

2

The isblank function tests for any character that is a standard blank character or is one
of a locale-specific set of characters for which isspace is true and that is used to
separate words within a line of text. The standard blank characters are the following:
space (' '), and horizontal tab ('\t'). In the "C" locale, isblank returns true only
for the standard blank characters.
