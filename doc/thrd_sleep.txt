7.26.5.7 The thrd_sleep function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <threads.h>
int thrd_sleep(const struct timespec *duration,
struct timespec *remaining);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The thrd_sleep function suspends execution of the calling thread until either the
interval specified by duration has elapsed or a signal which is not being ignored is
received. If interrupted by a signal and the remaining argument is not null, the
amount of time remaining (the requested interval minus the time actually slept) is stored
in the interval it points to. The duration and remaining arguments may point to the
same object.

3

The suspension time may be longer than requested because the interval is rounded up to
an integer multiple of the sleep resolution or because of the scheduling of other activity
by the system. But, except for the case of being interrupted by a signal, the suspension
time shall not be less than that specified, as measured by the system clock TIME_UTC.

==============================================================================
Returns

4

The thrd_sleep function returns zero if the requested time has elapsed, -1 if it has
been interrupted by a signal, or a negative value if it fails.
