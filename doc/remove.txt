7.21.4.1 The remove function
Synopsis

#include <stdio.h>
int remove(const char *filename);
Description

2

The remove function causes the file whose name is the string pointed to by filename
to be no longer accessible by that name. A subsequent attempt to open that file using that
name will fail, unless it is created anew. If the file is open, the behavior of the remove
function is implementation-defined.
Returns

3

The remove function returns zero if the operation succeeds, nonzero if it fails.
