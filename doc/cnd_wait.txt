7.26.3.6 The cnd_wait function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <threads.h>
int cnd_wait(cnd_t *cond, mtx_t *mtx);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The cnd_wait function atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mtx and endeavors
to block until the condition variable pointed to by cond is signaled by a call to
cnd_signal or to cnd_broadcast. When the calling thread becomes unblocked it
locks the mutex pointed to by mtx before it returns. The cnd_wait function requires
that the mutex pointed to by mtx be locked by the calling thread.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The cnd_wait function returns thrd_success on success or thrd_error if the
request could not be honored.
