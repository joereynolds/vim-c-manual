7.21.8.1 The fread function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
size_t fread(void * restrict ptr,
size_t size, size_t nmemb,
FILE * restrict stream);
Description

2

The fread function reads, into the array pointed to by ptr, up to nmemb elements
whose size is specified by size, from the stream pointed to by stream. For each
object, size calls are made to the fgetc function and the results stored, in the order
read, in an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The file position
indicator for the stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of characters successfully
read. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is
indeterminate. If a partial element is read, its value is indeterminate.
Returns

3

The fread function returns the number of elements successfully read, which may be
less than nmemb if a read error or end-of-file is encountered. If size or nmemb is zero,
fread returns zero and the contents of the array and the state of the stream remain
unchanged.
