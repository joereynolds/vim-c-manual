7.29.3.2 The fgetws function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t * restrict s,
int n, FILE * restrict stream);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The fgetws function reads at most one less than the number of wide characters
specified by n from the stream pointed to by stream into the array pointed to by s. No
additional wide characters are read after a new-line wide character (which is retained) or
after end-of-file. A null wide character is written immediately after the last wide
character read into the array.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The fgetws function returns s if successful. If end-of-file is encountered and no
characters have been read into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a
null pointer is returned. If a read or encoding error occurs during the operation, the array
contents are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.
