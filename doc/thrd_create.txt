7.26.5.1 The thrd_create function
Synopsis
1

#include <threads.h>
int thrd_create(thrd_t *thr, thrd_start_t func,
void *arg);
Description

2

The thrd_create function creates a new thread executing func(arg). If the
thrd_create function succeeds, it sets the object pointed to by thr to the identifier of
the newly created thread. (A threadâ€™s identifier may be reused for a different thread once
the original thread has exited and either been detached or joined to another thread.) The
completion of the thrd_create function synchronizes with the beginning of the
execution of the new thread.
Returns

3

The thrd_create function returns thrd_success on success, or thrd_nomem if
no memory could be allocated for the thread requested, or thrd_error if the request
could not be honored.
