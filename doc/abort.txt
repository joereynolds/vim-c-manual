7.22.4.1 The abort function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdlib.h>
_Noreturn void abort(void);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The abort function causes abnormal program termination to occur, unless the signal
SIGABRT is being caught and the signal handler does not return. Whether open streams
with unwritten buffered data are flushed, open streams are closed, or temporary files are
removed is implementation-defined. An implementation-defined form of the status
unsuccessful termination is returned to the host environment by means of the function
call raise(SIGABRT).

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The abort function does not return to its caller.
