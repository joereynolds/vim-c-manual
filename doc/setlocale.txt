7.11.1.1 The setlocale function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <locale.h>
char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The setlocale function selects the appropriate portion of the program’s locale as
specified by the category and locale arguments. The setlocale function may be
used to change or query the program’s entire current locale or portions thereof. The value
LC_ALL for category names the program’s entire locale; the other values for
category name only a portion of the program’s locale. LC_COLLATE affects the
behavior of the strcoll and strxfrm functions. LC_CTYPE affects the behavior of
the character handling functions224) and the multibyte and wide character functions.
LC_MONETARY affects the monetary formatting information returned by the
localeconv function. LC_NUMERIC affects the decimal-point character for the
formatted input/output functions and the string conversion functions, as well as the
nonmonetary formatting information returned by the localeconv function. LC_TIME
affects the behavior of the strftime and wcsftime functions.

3

A value of "C" for locale specifies the minimal environment for C translation; a value
of "" for locale specifies the locale-specific native environment. Other
implementation-defined strings may be passed as the second argument to setlocale.
222) ISO/IEC 9945−2 specifies locale and charmap formats that may be used to specify locales for C.
223) See ‘‘future library directions’’ (7.31.6).
224) The only functions in 7.4 whose behavior is not affected by the current locale are isdigit and
isxdigit.

At program startup, the equivalent of
setlocale(LC_ALL, "C");
is executed.

5

A call to the setlocale function may introduce a data race with other calls to the
setlocale function or with calls to functions that are affected by the current locale.
The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the setlocale function.

==============================================================================
Returns

6

If a pointer to a string is given for locale and the selection can be honored, the
setlocale function returns a pointer to the string associated with the specified
category for the new locale. If the selection cannot be honored, the setlocale
function returns a null pointer and the program’s locale is not changed.

7

A null pointer for locale causes the setlocale function to return a pointer to the
string associated with the category for the program’s current locale; the program’s
locale is not changed.225)

8

The pointer to string returned by the setlocale function is such that a subsequent call
with that string value and its associated category will restore that part of the program’s
locale. The string pointed to shall not be modified by the program, but may be
overwritten by a subsequent call to the setlocale function.
