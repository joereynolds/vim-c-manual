7.6.2.3 The feraiseexcept function
Synopsis
1

#include <fenv.h>
int feraiseexcept(int excepts);
Description

2

The feraiseexcept function attempts to raise the supported floating-point exceptions
represented by its argument.216) The order in which these floating-point exceptions are
raised is unspecified, except as stated in F.8.6. Whether the feraiseexcept function
additionally raises the ‘‘inexact’’ floating-point exception whenever it raises the
‘‘overflow’’ or ‘‘underflow’’ floating-point exception is implementation-defined.
Returns

3

The feraiseexcept function returns zero if the excepts argument is zero or if all
the specified exceptions were successfully raised. Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value.

216) The effect is intended to be similar to that of floating-point exceptions raised by arithmetic operations.
Hence, enabled traps for floating-point exceptions raised by this function are taken. The specification
in F.8.6 is in the same spirit.
