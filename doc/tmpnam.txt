7.21.4.4 The tmpnam function

Synopsis

#include <stdio.h>
char *tmpnam(char *s);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The tmpnam function generates a string that is a valid file name and that is not the same
as the name of an existing file.270) The function is potentially capable of generating at

269) Among the reasons the implementation may cause the rename function to fail are that the file is open
or that it is necessary to copy its contents to effectuate its renaming.
270) Files created using strings generated by the tmpnam function are temporary only in the sense that
their names should not collide with those generated by conventional naming rules for the
implementation. It is still necessary to use the remove function to remove such files when their use
is ended, and before program termination.

least TMP_MAX different strings, but any or all of them may already be in use by existing
files and thus not be suitable return values.
3

The tmpnam function generates a different string each time it is called.

4

Calls to the tmpnam function with a null pointer argument may introduce data races with
each other. The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the tmpnam
function.

==============================================================================
Returns

5

If no suitable string can be generated, the tmpnam function returns a null pointer.
Otherwise, if the argument is a null pointer, the tmpnam function leaves its result in an
internal static object and returns a pointer to that object (subsequent calls to the tmpnam
function may modify the same object). If the argument is not a null pointer, it is assumed
to point to an array of at least L_tmpnam chars; the tmpnam function writes its result
in that array and returns the argument as its value.
Environmental limits

6

The value of the macro TMP_MAX shall be at least 25.
