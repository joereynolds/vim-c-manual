7.24.3.2 The strncat function
Synopsis
1

#include <string.h>
char *strncat(char * restrict s1,
const char * restrict s2,
size_t n);
Description

2

The strncat function appends not more than n characters (a null character and
characters that follow it are not appended) from the array pointed to by s2 to the end of
the string pointed to by s1. The initial character of s2 overwrites the null character at the
end of s1. A terminating null character is always appended to the result.309) If copying
308) Thus, if there is no null character in the first n characters of the array pointed to by s2, the result will
not be null-terminated.
309) Thus, the maximum number of characters that can end up in the array pointed to by s1 is
strlen(s1)+n+1.

takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
Returns
3

The strncat function returns the value of s1.
Forward references: the strlen function (7.24.6.3).

7.24.4 Comparison functions
1

The sign of a nonzero value returned by the comparison functions memcmp, strcmp,
and strncmp is determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first
pair of characters (both interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in the objects being
compared.
