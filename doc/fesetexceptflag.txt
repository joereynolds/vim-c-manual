7.6.2.4 The fesetexceptflag function
Synopsis
1

#include <fenv.h>
int fesetexceptflag(const fexcept_t *flagp,
int excepts);
Description

2

The fesetexceptflag function attempts to set the floating-point status flags
indicated by the argument excepts to the states stored in the object pointed to by
flagp. The value of *flagp shall have been set by a previous call to
fegetexceptflag whose second argument represented at least those floating-point
exceptions represented by the argument excepts. This function does not raise floatingpoint exceptions, but only sets the state of the flags.
Returns

3

The fesetexceptflag function returns zero if the excepts argument is zero or if
all the specified flags were successfully set to the appropriate state. Otherwise, it returns
a nonzero value.
