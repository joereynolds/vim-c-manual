7.24.5.1 The memchr function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <string.h>
void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The memchr function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to an unsigned
char) in the initial n characters (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object
pointed to by s. The implementation shall behave as if it reads the characters sequentially
and stops as soon as a matching character is found.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The memchr function returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer if the
character does not occur in the object.
