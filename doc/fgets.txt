7.21.7.2 The fgets function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
char *fgets(char * restrict s, int n,
FILE * restrict stream);
Description

2

The fgets function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by n
from the stream pointed to by stream into the array pointed to by s. No additional
characters are read after a new-line character (which is retained) or after end-of-file. A
null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.
Returns

3

The fgets function returns s if successful. If end-of-file is encountered and no
characters have been read into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a
null pointer is returned. If a read error occurs during the operation, the array contents are
indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.
