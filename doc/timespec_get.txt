Synopsis

#include <time.h>
int timespec_get(struct timespec *ts, int base);
Description

2

The timespec_get function sets the interval pointed to by ts to hold the current
calendar time based on the specified time base.

3

If base is TIME_UTC, the tv_sec member is set to the number of seconds since an
implementation defined epoch, truncated to a whole value and the tv_nsec member is
set to the integral number of nanoseconds, rounded to the resolution of the system

Returns

If the timespec_get function is successful it returns the nonzero value base;
otherwise, it returns zero.

7.27.3 Time conversion functions
1

Except for the strftime function, these functions each return a pointer to one of two
types of static objects: a broken-down time structure or an array of char. Execution of
any of the functions that return a pointer to one of these object types may overwrite the
information in any object of the same type pointed to by the value returned from any
previous call to any of them and the functions are not required to avoid data races with
each other.322) The implementation shall behave as if no other library functions call these
functions.
