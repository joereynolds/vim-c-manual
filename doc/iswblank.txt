The iswblank function tests for any wide character that is a standard blank wide
character or is one of a locale-specific set of wide characters for which iswspace is true
and that is used to separate words within a line of text. The standard blank wide
characters are the following: space (L' '), and horizontal tab (L'\t'). In the "C"
locale, iswblank returns true only for the standard blank characters.
