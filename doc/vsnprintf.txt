7.21.6.12 The vsnprintf function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int vsnprintf(char * restrict s, size_t n,
const char * restrict format,
va_list arg);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The vsnprintf function is equivalent to snprintf, with the variable argument list
replaced by arg, which shall have been initialized by the va_start macro (and
possibly subsequent va_arg calls). The vsnprintf function does not invoke the
va_end macro.288) If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The vsnprintf function returns the number of characters that would have been written
had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character, or a negative
value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the null-terminated output has been
completely written if and only if the returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
