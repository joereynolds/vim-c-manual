7.21.6.5 The snprintf function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
int snprintf(char * restrict s, size_t n,
const char * restrict format, ...);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is written into
an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream. If n is zero, nothing is written,
and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise, output characters beyond the n-1st are
discarded rather than being written to the array, and a null character is written at the end
of the characters actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The snprintf function returns the number of characters that would have been written
had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character, or a negative
value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the null-terminated output has been
completely written if and only if the returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
