7.29.6.2.1 The mbsinit function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <wchar.h>
int mbsinit(const mbstate_t *ps);

==============================================================================
Description

2

If ps is not a null pointer, the mbsinit function determines whether the referenced
mbstate_t object describes an initial conversion state.

==============================================================================
Returns
3

The mbsinit function returns nonzero if ps is a null pointer or if the referenced object
describes an initial conversion state; otherwise, it returns zero.

7.29.6.3 Restartable multibyte/wide character conversion functions
1

These functions differ from the corresponding multibyte character functions of 7.22.7
(mblen, mbtowc, and wctomb) in that they have an extra parameter, ps, of type
pointer to mbstate_t that points to an object that can completely describe the current
conversion state of the associated multibyte character sequence. If ps is a null pointer,
each function uses its own internal mbstate_t object instead, which is initialized at
program startup to the initial conversion state; the functions are not required to avoid data
races with other calls to the same function in this case. The implementation behaves as if
no library function calls these functions with a null pointer for ps.

2

Also unlike their corresponding functions, the return value does not represent whether the
encoding is state-dependent.
