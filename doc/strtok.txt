7.24.5.8 The strtok function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <string.h>
char *strtok(char * restrict s1,
const char * restrict s2);

==============================================================================
Description

2

A sequence of calls to the strtok function breaks the string pointed to by s1 into a
sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a character from the string pointed to
by s2. The first call in the sequence has a non-null first argument; subsequent calls in the
sequence have a null first argument. The separator string pointed to by s2 may be
different from call to call.

3

The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by s1 for the first character
that is not contained in the current separator string pointed to by s2. If no such character
is found, then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by s1 and the strtok function
returns a null pointer. If such a character is found, it is the start of the first token.

4

The strtok function then searches from there for a character that is contained in the
current separator string. If no such character is found, the current token extends to the
end of the string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches for a token will return a null
pointer. If such a character is found, it is overwritten by a null character, which
terminates the current token. The strtok function saves a pointer to the following
character, from which the next search for a token will start.

5

Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the first argument, starts
searching from the saved pointer and behaves as described above.

6

The strtok function is not required to avoid data races with other calls to the strtok
function.311) The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the strtok
function.

==============================================================================
Returns

7

The strtok function returns a pointer to the first character of a token, or a null pointer
if there is no token.
