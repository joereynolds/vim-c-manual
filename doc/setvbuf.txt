7.21.5.6 The setvbuf function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
int setvbuf(FILE * restrict stream,
char * restrict buf,
int mode, size_t size);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The setvbuf function may be used only after the stream pointed to by stream has
been associated with an open file and before any other operation (other than an
unsuccessful call to setvbuf) is performed on the stream. The argument mode
determines how stream will be buffered, as follows: _IOFBF causes input/output to be
fully buffered; _IOLBF causes input/output to be line buffered; _IONBF causes
input/output to be unbuffered. If buf is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be
used instead of a buffer allocated by the setvbuf function273) and the argument size
specifies the size of the array; otherwise, size may determine the size of a buffer
allocated by the setvbuf function. The contents of the array at any time are
indeterminate.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The setvbuf function returns zero on success, or nonzero if an invalid value is given
for mode or if the request cannot be honored.

273) The buffer has to have a lifetime at least as great as the open stream, so the stream should be closed
before a buffer that has automatic storage duration is deallocated upon block exit.
