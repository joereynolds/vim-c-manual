7.27.2.1 The clock function
Synopsis
1

#include <time.h>
clock_t clock(void);
Description

2

The clock function determines the processor time used.
Returns

3

The clock function returns the implementation’s best approximation to the processor
time used by the program since the beginning of an implementation-defined era related
only to the program invocation. To determine the time in seconds, the value returned by
the clock function should be divided by the value of the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC. If
the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented, the function
returns the value (clock_t)(-1).319)

318) The range [0, 60] for tm_sec allows for a positive leap second.
319) In order to measure the time spent in a program, the clock function should be called at the start of
the program and its return value subtracted from the value returned by subsequent calls.
