#include <string.h>
char *strcat(char * restrict s1,
const char * restrict s2);
Description

The strcat function appends a copy of the string pointed to by s2 (including the
terminating null character) to the end of the string pointed to by s1. The initial character
of s2 overwrites the null character at the end of s1. If copying takes place between
objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
Returns
