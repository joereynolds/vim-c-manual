7.22.8.1 The mbstowcs function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdlib.h>
size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t * restrict pwcs,
const char * restrict s,
size_t n);
Description

2

The mbstowcs function converts a sequence of multibyte characters that begins in the
initial shift state from the array pointed to by s into a sequence of corresponding wide
characters and stores not more than n wide characters into the array pointed to by pwcs.
No multibyte characters that follow a null character (which is converted into a null wide
character) will be examined or converted. Each multibyte character is converted as if by
a call to the mbtowc function, except that the conversion state of the mbtowc function is
not affected.

3

No more than n elements will be modified in the array pointed to by pwcs. If copying
takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
Returns

4

If an invalid multibyte character is encountered, the mbstowcs function returns
(size_t)(-1). Otherwise, the mbstowcs function returns the number of array
elements modified, not including a terminating null wide character, if any.306)

306) The array will not be null-terminated if the value returned is n.
