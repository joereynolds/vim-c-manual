7.22.4.7 The quick_exit function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdlib.h>
_Noreturn void quick_exit(int status);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The quick_exit function causes normal program termination to occur. No functions
registered by the atexit function or signal handlers registered by the signal function
are called. If a program calls the quick_exit function more than once, or calls the
exit function in addition to the quick_exit function, the behavior is undefined. If a
signal is raised while the quick_exit function is executing, the behavior is undefined.

3

The quick_exit function first calls all functions registered by the at_quick_exit
function, in the reverse order of their registration,301) except that a function is called after
any previously registered functions that had already been called at the time it was
registered. If, during the call to any such function, a call to the longjmp function is
made that would terminate the call to the registered function, the behavior is undefined.

4

Then control is returned to the host environment by means of the function call
_Exit(status).

==============================================================================
Returns

5

The quick_exit function cannot return to its caller.
