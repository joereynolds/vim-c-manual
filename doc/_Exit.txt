*_Exit*

7.22.4.5 The _Exit function

==============================================================================
Synopsis
1

#include <stdlib.h>
_Noreturn void _Exit(int status);

==============================================================================
Description

2

The _Exit function causes normal program termination to occur and control to be
returned to the host environment. No functions registered by the atexit function, the
at_quick_exit function, or signal handlers registered by the signal function are
called. The status returned to the host environment is determined in the same way as for
the exit function (7.22.4.4). Whether open streams with unwritten buffered data are
flushed, open streams are closed, or temporary files are removed is implementationdefined.

==============================================================================
Returns

3

The _Exit function cannot return to its caller.
