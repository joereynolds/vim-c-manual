Synopsis

#include <stdio.h>
int rename(const char *old, const char *new);
Description

The rename function causes the file whose name is the string pointed to by old to be
henceforth known by the name given by the string pointed to by new. The file named
old is no longer accessible by that name. If a file named by the string pointed to by new
exists prior to the call to the rename function, the behavior is implementation-defined.
