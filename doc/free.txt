7.22.3.3 The free function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdlib.h>
void free(void *ptr);
Description

2

The free function causes the space pointed to by ptr to be deallocated, that is, made
available for further allocation. If ptr is a null pointer, no action occurs. Otherwise, if
the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management
function, or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc, the
behavior is undefined.
Returns

3

The free function returns no value.

296) Note that this need not be the same as the representation of floating-point zero or a null pointer
constant.
