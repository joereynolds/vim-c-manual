7.29.2.10 The vwscanf function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdarg.h>
#include <wchar.h>
int vwscanf(const wchar_t * restrict format,
va_list arg);
Description

2

The vwscanf function is equivalent to wscanf, with the variable argument list
replaced by arg, which shall have been initialized by the va_start macro (and
possibly subsequent va_arg calls). The vwscanf function does not invoke the
va_end macro.340)
Returns

3

The vwscanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
before the first conversion (if any) has completed. Otherwise, the vwscanf function
returns the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even
zero, in the event of an early matching failure.
