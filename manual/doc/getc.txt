7.21.7.5 The getc function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
int getc(FILE *stream);
Description

2

The getc function is equivalent to fgetc, except that if it is implemented as a macro, it
may evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never be an expression
with side effects.
Returns

3

The getc function returns the next character from the input stream pointed to by
stream. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set and
getc returns EOF. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set and
getc returns EOF.
