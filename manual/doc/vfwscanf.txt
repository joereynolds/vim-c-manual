7.29.2.6 The vfwscanf function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
int vfwscanf(FILE * restrict stream,
const wchar_t * restrict format,
va_list arg);
Description

2

The vfwscanf function is equivalent to fwscanf, with the variable argument list
replaced by arg, which shall have been initialized by the va_start macro (and
possibly subsequent va_arg calls). The vfwscanf function does not invoke the
va_end macro.340)
Returns

3

The vfwscanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
before the first conversion (if any) has completed. Otherwise, the vfwscanf function
returns the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even
zero, in the event of an early matching failure.
