Description
2

The sprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is written into
an array (specified by the argument s) rather than to a stream. A null character is written
at the end of the characters written; it is not counted as part of the returned value. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
Returns

3

The sprintf function returns the number of characters written in the array, not
counting the terminating null character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred.
