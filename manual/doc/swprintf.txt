7.29.2.3 The swprintf function
Synopsis
1

#include <wchar.h>
int swprintf(wchar_t * restrict s,
size_t n,
const wchar_t * restrict format, ...);
Description

2

The swprintf function is equivalent to fwprintf, except that the argument s
specifies an array of wide characters into which the generated output is to be written,
rather than written to a stream. No more than n wide characters are written, including a
terminating null wide character, which is always added (unless n is zero).
Returns

3

The swprintf function returns the number of wide characters written in the array, not
counting the terminating null wide character, or a negative value if an encoding error
occurred or if n or more wide characters were requested to be written.
