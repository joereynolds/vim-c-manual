7.21.9.3 The fsetpos function
Synopsis
1

#include <stdio.h>
int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);
Description

2

The fsetpos function sets the mbstate_t object (if any) and file position indicator
for the stream pointed to by stream according to the value of the object pointed to by
pos, which shall be a value obtained from an earlier successful call to the fgetpos
function on a stream associated with the same file. If a read or write error occurs, the
error indicator for the stream is set and fsetpos fails.

3

A successful call to the fsetpos function undoes any effects of the ungetc function
on the stream, clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream, and then establishes the new
parse state and position. After a successful fsetpos call, the next operation on an
update stream may be either input or output.
Returns

4

If successful, the fsetpos function returns zero; on failure, the fsetpos function
returns nonzero and stores an implementation-defined positive value in errno.
