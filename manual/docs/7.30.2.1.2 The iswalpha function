7.30.2.1.2 The iswalpha function
Synopsis

#include <wctype.h>
int iswalpha(wint_t wc);
Description

2

The iswalpha function tests for any wide character for which iswupper or
iswlower is true, or any wide character that is one of a locale-specific set of alphabetic
353) For example, if the expression isalpha(wctob(wc)) evaluates to true, then the call
iswalpha(wc) also returns true. But, if the expression isgraph(wctob(wc)) evaluates to true
(which cannot occur for wc == L' ' of course), then either iswgraph(wc) or iswprint(wc)
&& iswspace(wc) is true, but not both.
